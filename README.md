 A bank account is operated by a father and his son. The account is opened with an initial deposit of Rs. 600. Thereafter, the father deposits a random amount between Re. 1 and Rs. 200 each time, until the account balance crosses Rs. 2,000. The son can start withdrawing the amount only if the balance exceeds Rs. 2,000. Thereafter, the son withdraws random amount between Re. 1 and Rs. 150, until the balance goes below Rs. 500. Once the balance becomes less than Rs.500, the father deposits amount till it crosses Rs. 2,000 and the process continues. Write a Father and Son thread to carry out the above process. Use the multithreading concepts wait, notify, notifyall, sleep and synchronized
